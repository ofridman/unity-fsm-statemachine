Unity FSM State Machine C#

State machines are a very effective way to manage game state, either on your main game play object (Game Over, Restart, Continue etc) or on individual actors and NPCs (AI behaviours, Animations, etc). The following is a simple state machine that should work well within any Unity context.

Designed with simplicity in mind
Most state machines come from the world of C# enterprise, and are wonderfully complicated or require a lot of boilerplate code. State Machines however are an incredibly useful pattern in game development, administrative overhead should never be a burden that discourages you from writing good code.

Simple use of Enums as state definition.
Minimal initialization – one line of code.
Incredibly easy to add/remove states
Uses reflection to avoid boiler plate code – only write the methods you actually need.
Compatible with Coroutines.
Tested on iOS and Android
